#DATA STRUCTURE
"""
Data structures are fundamental concepts of computer science which
helps is writing efficient programs in any language.

Python Specific Data Structures
These data structures are specific to python language
and they give greater flexibility in storing different types
of data and faster processing in python environment.

List: It is similar to array with the exception that the data
elements can be of different data types.
You can have both numeric and string data in a python list.

Tuple: Tuples are similar to lists but they are immutable which means
the values in a tuple cannot be modified they can only be read.

Dictionary: The dictionary contains Key-value pairs as its data elements.


The various data structures in computer science are divided broadly
into two categories shown below.
We will discuss about each of the below data
structures in detail in subsequent chapters.

Liner Data Structures

These are the data structures which store the data elements in a sequential manner.

Array: It is a sequential arrangement of data elements paired with the index of the
data element.

Linked List: Each data element contains a link to another element along
with the data present in it.

Stack: It is a data structure which follows only to specific order of operation.
LIFO(last in First Out) or FILO(First in Last Out).

Queue: It is similar to Stack but the order of operation is
only FIFO(First In First Out).

Matrix: It is two dimensional data structure in which the data element
is referred by a pair of indices.


Non-Liner Data Structures

These are the data structures in which there is no sequential linking of data elements.
Any pair or group of data elements can be linked to each other and
can be accessed without a strict sequence.

Binary Tree: It is a data structure where each data element
can be connected to maximum two other data elements and it starts with a root node.

Heap: It is a special case of Tree data structure where the data in the parent node
is either strictly greater than/ equal to the child nodes or
strictly less than itâ€™s child nodes.

Hash Table: It is a data structure which is made of arrays associated with each other
using a hash function. It retrieves values using keys rather
than index from a data element.

Graph: .It is an arrangement of vertices and nodes where some of the
nodes are connected to each other through links.

#2d array
"""
Two dimensional array is an array within an array. It is an array of arrays.
In this type of array the position of an data element is referred by
two indices instead of one.
So it represents a table with rows an dcolumns of data.
"""

twoDArray =[[2,3,1],[4,6,5],[9,7,8]] #intializing

print(twoDArray[0][1],"\n") #accesing one element

print(twoDArray[1],"\n") #accesing one row

for x in twoDArray: #looping through 2d array
    for y in x:
        print(y,end=" ")
    print()
print(" ")

twoDArray.insert(3,[3,6,1])

for x in twoDArray:
    for y in x:
        print(y,end=" ")

#Matrix
"""
Matrix is a special case of two dimensional array
where each data element is of strictly same size
"""


#Maps
"""
Python Maps also called ChainMap is
a type of data structure to manage multiple dictionaries together as one unit.
"""
import collections as col
dict1 = {'day1': 'Mon', 'day2': 'Tue'}
dict2 = {'day3': 'Wed', 'day1': 'Thu'}

print(res.maps,"\n")

# Print all the elements from the result
print('elements:')
for key, val in res.items():
    print('{} = {}'.format(key, val))
print()

# Find a specific value in the result
print('day3 in res: {}'.format(('day1' in res)))
print('day4 in res: {}'.format(('day4' in res)))

"""
When the element of the dictionary is updated,
the result is instantly updated in the result of the ChainMap.
"""

#Linked List

"""
A linked list is a sequence of data elements, which are connected together via links.
Each data element contains a connection to another data element in form of a pointer.
"""

#Creation of Linked List
"""
A linked list is created by using the node class.
We create a Node object and create another class to use this node object.
We pass the appropriate values thorugh the node object to point
the to the next data elements
