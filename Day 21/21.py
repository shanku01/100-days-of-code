#Circular LinkedList

"""
Circular linked list is a linked list where all nodes are connected to form
a circle. There is no NULL at the end. A circular linked list can be a singly
circular linked list or doubly circular linked list.
"""

"""
Advantages of Circular Linked Lists:
1) Any node can be a starting point. We can traverse the whole list by
starting from any point. We just need to stop when the first visited node is
visited again.

2) Useful for implementation of queue. Unlike this implementation,
we donâ€™t need to maintain two pointers for front and rear if we use
circular linked list. We can maintain a pointer to the last inserted node
and front can always be obtained as next of last.

3) Circular lists are useful in applications to repeatedly go around the list.
For example, when multiple applications are running on a PC, it is common for
the operating system to put the running applications on a list and then to
cycle through them, giving each of them a slice of time to execute, and then
making them wait while the CPU is given to another application.
It is convenient for the operating system to use a circular list so that
when it reaches the end of the list it can cycle around to the front ofthe list.

4) Circular Doubly Linked Lists are used for implementation of advanced
data structures like Fibonacci Heap.

##Spliting List in Two haves
"""
1) Store the mid and last pointers of the circular linked list
using tortoise and hare algorithm.
2) Make the second half circular.
3) Make the first half circular.
4) Set head (or start) pointers of the two linked lists.
